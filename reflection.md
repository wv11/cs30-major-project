## Advice I Would Give Myself If I Was Starting A Project Like This Again

I definetly wish I started with p5.play. It would've helped me a lot, especially with collision detection, which I never ended up figuring out in the end.
I also wish I had more time to work on it. I don't think I put in as much time as I had hoped I would, so the project I was hoping for ended up being very
unfinished. A lot of time went into trying to figure stuff out that I didn't end up figuring out, which is another reason I wish I used p5.play, as it probably
would have saved me a lot of time.


## Hardest Part

I'd say the hardest part was figuring out how to get the text to alternate after every click. Even after using a json file to do so, it would cause errors that I had no
idea how to fix. But in the end, I did find a solution, which was to have the state change after the json file reached "END", instead of having it change at the end of the
file, because that seemed to cause errors. Another hard part was getting the bullets to fire properly. I wanted to have them alternate from shooting on each side of the screen,
but finding a way to do so was difficult.


## Unsolved Problems

Collision detection is the main one. Like I said, it would've been much easier with p5.play. I tried using p5.collide2d, but I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted it to. Also,
in the "How To Play" section, I wasn't able to set bounderies for the scroll wheel. I think that if I spent more time on it, I'd be able to figure it out, but I just don't have
anymore time. Another problem I had, which isn't actually part of the code, was beta testing. I didn't get far enough into my project to have as much as I wanted to show during beta testing. Most of my needs to have were not met, and none of my nice to have.
