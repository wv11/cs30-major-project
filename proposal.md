# Proposal

For my final project, I'm going to be creating an adventure story game that will include battles between the player and characters, with certain aspects
being inspired by Undertale.


## Needs to have list

- At least 1 battle between a character and the player
- At least 5 characters in the story
- Music, theme songs for each character (made by me)
- Ending scenes, one for winning, one for losing
- Hp bar for the player



## Nice to have list

- 3 battles between different characters and the player
- Get the players name, and have it used in story dialogue
- Have the dialogue text gradually write out instead of all appearing at once
